## Getting Started with Spree Commerce

Welcome to the Spree Commerce documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to build and deploy your Spree Commerce store.

<Info>
  If you want to add Spree to your existing Rails application, you can skip this page and go to the [Adding to an existing Rails app](adding_spree_to_rails_app) section.
</Info>

### 1. Installing Spree

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Creating Your Spree Repository">

    To create your Spree store repository please, follow these instructions:
    
    [Use Spree starter template](https://github.com/new?template_name=spree_starter&template_owner=spree) to create your own repository

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Setting up Your Development Environment">

    <Note>
      If you're on Windows remember to [install the Linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) before proceeding.
    </Note>

    1. Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)

    2. Once git is installed, clone your docs repository using 
    
        ```basgh
        git clone <your-repo>
        ```
        
        <Info>
        If you haven't set it up yet, now would be a good time to do so with these [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
        </Info>

    3. Open a terminal and go to the repository directory
    4. Run setup commands:

        ```bash
        bin/setup
        ```
    5. And finally start the development server with:

        ```bash
        bin/rails s
        ```
  </Accordion>  

  <Accordion icon="box" title="Adding sample data">

    To add sample data to your store, run:

    ```bash
    bin/rake spree_sample:load
    ```

    This will add a some products, categories, and will setup a checkout flow to your store.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Exploring Your Store

Feel free to explore your store. You can do so because Spree comes with a default pre-built Storefront and Admin Panel.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Logging into the Admin Dashboard">
    Use your browser window to navigate to [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin). You can log in with the default credentials:
      - login: `spree@example.com`
      - password: `spree123`

    Upon successful authentication, you should see the admin screen:

    Feel free to explore some of the Admin Panel features that Spree has to offer and to verify that your installation is working properly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Browsing Storefront">
  
    Spree comes with a default pre-built Storefront. You can access it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
    
    You can later customize this Storefront or choose another one if you prefer Next.js or Vue.js.
